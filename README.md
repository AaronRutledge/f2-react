## Synopsis

This is a F2 app example written in ES2015 syntax that loads a basic React component defined in
the F2 App_Class definition.  We use Webpack to transpile the code from ES2015 and JSX syntax to ES5.  The transpiled code is loaded into build/appBundle.js.


## Installation
1.  **Install webpack as a global package:** npm install webpack -g
2.  **Install node modules:** npm install
3.  **Run:** npm start
